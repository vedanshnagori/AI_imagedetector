# AI-Generated vs Real Image Detector
## Overview
This project is a binary image classification model that distinguishes between AI-generated and real images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques such as EfficientNet. The goal is to improve our ability to detect synthetic images, which is becoming increasingly important in the era of deepfakes and AI-generated media.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from [Vista-25 Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vista-25/data).
It consists of 12,000 AI-generated and 12,000 real images.
Images are provided in standard RGB format and preprocessed before training.
